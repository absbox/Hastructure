# Why Hastructure ?
* :dollar: A structured finance cashflow engine written in Haskell 
* :coffee: Easy integration with Java/C#/C++/JavaScript/Python with RESTful interface and Docker image ready
* :bricks: A building block engine to model cashflows of structured product, all the formula and variables are exposed.
* :car: In-house and white-label friendly.
* :flags: No lockdown, all JSONs input/output, no private file formats.
* :snake: [Python wrapper](https://github.com/yellowbean/PyABS) on the way

### Online Demo

The demo only cover very limit features of this engine and subject to UI performance issue due to rapid prototype design of web component

**Pls noted that the web demo is far behind latest development/stable version**
